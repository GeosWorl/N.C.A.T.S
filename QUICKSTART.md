```

Edit `.env` file:
```bash
# Required for deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix

# Required for testnet/mainnet
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Optional

```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
npm run verify-setup
```

### 4. Compile Contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

### 5. Deploy

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local node
npm run node

# Terminal 2: Deploy to local network
npm run deploy:localhost
```

**Testnet (Recommended for testing):**
```bash
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

**Mainnet (Production):**
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment, you'll receive:
- Contract address
- Transaction hash
- Deployment record in `deployments/` directory
